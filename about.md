<p>I'm a humble but effective leader. As a manager I'm more a driver of tasks than a decision holder. I engage through conviction and empathy rather than persuasion and pressure. As a teammate I put myself in the other person's shoes. I'm constantly looking for a balance to get the job done</p>

<p>I enjoy planning and being part of development of business that deal with the following questions:</p>

- How to live better with a longer life expectancy?
- How to deal with the technical, historical and economic literacy?
- How to empower people to take better decisions about their well being?

In InfoElder we believe people with age-related impairments should still have the possibility of making choices about their well-being.
